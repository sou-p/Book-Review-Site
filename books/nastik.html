                <p><strong>Nastik: Why I Am Not an Atheist</strong> by <strong>Kushal Mehra</strong> is a thought-provoking non-fiction book that provides a critical response to modern atheism, especially within the Indian context. It's not a defense of any specific religion. Instead, Mehra explores the philosophical and historical reasons why someone might choose not to identify as an atheist, even if they don't follow traditional religious beliefs.</p>
                <p>The book challenges common arguments made by "new atheism." It delves into ideas of <strong>meaning, morality, and consciousness</strong> from perspectives that often draw on rich <strong>indigenous Indian philosophical traditions</strong>. Mehra argues that a purely reductionist atheist view can overlook key aspects of human experience and India's sophisticated intellectual heritage. This work offers a deep dive into the ongoing debate between faith, reason, and the search for ultimate truth, encouraging readers to look beyond simple belief vs. disbelief.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading"><i class="fa-solid fa-file-lines"></i> Summary</h3>
                <p>Kushal Mehra's "Nastik" directly engages with the modern atheist movement, particularly its more assertive forms. He carefully examines arguments often used to dismiss religious or spiritual thought, such as the problem of evil, the lack of empirical evidence for God, and the idea that belief is irrational. Rather than simply defending traditional religion, Mehra draws on a rich variety of philosophical arguments, notably from Indian thought, to posit that rejecting theism does not automatically mean fully embracing atheism.</p>
                <p>The book explores the concept of "<strong>Nastik</strong>" (one who does not believe in a personal God or certain Vedic authorities) within its broader historical and philosophical context in India, differentiating it from Western atheism. It delves into profound questions about <strong>human consciousness, the origins of morality, and the search for meaning</strong> in a seemingly indifferent universe. Mehra argues that a purely materialist and reductionist worldview falls short in explaining the full scope of human experience and intellectual inquiry. His work encourages readers to think beyond simple categories and appreciate the diverse ways humanity has sought answers to life's biggest questions.</p>
